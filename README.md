# Freecodecamp Advanced Front End Development Project
Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/KzXQgy/.

## Project Criteria:
* User Story: I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
* User Story: My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
* User Story: I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.
